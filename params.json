Objects detections recognize faces, etc., are some of the areas where CNNs are widely used. In this model, there are 4 convolution layer followed boy max-pooling layer and in each layer. Stride: 1 Padding: valid activation : Relu\r\n\r\nAfter 4 convolution layer, there is a flatten layer then there is 2 fully connected dense layer. Activation :Relu\r\n\r\nIn the output layer as there is two output as it is a binary classification and activation is sigmoid.\r\n\r\n# Summary of Model:\r\n\r\n![Summary of Model](https://github.com/rakib1521/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection/blob/master/Model/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection_model.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Detail of Model:\r\n\r\n![Detail of Model](https://github.com/rakib1521/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection/blob/master/Model/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection_model_detail.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Training and validation accuracy:\r\n![accuracy](https://github.com/rakib1521/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection/blob/master/Photos/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection_accuracy.png)\r\n\r\n# Training and validation loss:\r\n![loss](https://github.com/rakib1521/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection/blob/master/Photos/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection_loss.png)\r\n\r\n# output:\r\n  ![result](https://github.com/rakib1521/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection/blob/master/Photos/Pneumonia_Xray_Detection_result.PNG)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
